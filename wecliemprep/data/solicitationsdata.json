needs requires innovative actions resulting in technological, institutional and capacity-building solutions that are tailored to the risks, affordable, accepted by citizens, and customised and implemented for the (cross-sectoral) needs of practitioners. Innovative solutions are required to enable first responders to get a faster overview of any disaster situation based on the knowledge of past events and prevention actions. Complementing this, novel technologies and tools are necessary to enhance situational awareness in the case of disaster-prone events or health-related crises, especially in the case of cross-border situations, in order for first responders to be better prepared in emergency operations. In this context, innovative technologies are required for first responders to rapidly identify hazardous agents and contaminants such as CBRN-E substances in case of an accident, outbreak/pandemics or terrorist attack and act more efficiently and rapidly regarding communication. This requires novel rapid and accurate detection of substances (possibly coupled with unmanned vehicles or drones) and on-line communication systems to support first responders&rsquo; operations and to provide the ability to conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering them. Needs cover a broad range of technologies on top of existing CBRN-E detectors, e.g. samplers, separation systems, dilution or sample pre-concentrators etc., multiplying their capabilities. Advancements should take into consideration power consumption of front-end technology, as well as, transportability, on-line, dynamic sampling, automation, smart samplers, sample preparation, integration with detectors, standardisation. A focus should be made on experimental or commercial systems that are not optimised in terms of online, continuous measurements, power consumption and hyphenation. Other areas of research closely depending upon enhanced situational awareness and preparedness concern decisions related to the protection of first responders (e.g. advanced protective gear and smart wearable equipment), in particular in case of CBRN-related events (infectious diseases, accidental or linked to terrorism), and ways to minimise their time-to-react in urban areas or to conduct on-scene operations remotely without endangering responders (e.g. ways through traffic, UAVs etc.).</p><p>In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged, in particular with Japan in the framework of the EU-Japan collaboration.</p><p>Where possible and relevant, synergy-building and clustering initiatives with successful proposals in the same area should be considered, including the organisation of international conferences in close coordination with the Community for European Research and Innovation for Security (CERIS) activities and/or other

Based on the legacy of existing solutions, in particular in the area of extreme weather events, further developments are required to compare impact forecasting and early warning approaches at international level. The aim of such comparisons would be to design EU-wide decision-support and information systems supporting planning authorities and civil protection agencies in the rapid deployment of first responders and communication to citizens in vulnerable areas in the case of extreme climate events or geological disasters. This platform development might be prone to international cooperation, hence supporting the implementation of both EU policies and the UN Sendai Framework for Action. Innovation actions should improve measures and technologies that are needed to better plan for extreme climate events and geological disasters, reduce risks, as well as manage the immediate consequences of natural disasters, in particular regarding emergency responses. This should lead to sound and timely operational forecasts of severe (short-term focus) extreme weather events or geological hazards to aid planning authorities, civil protection agencies and first responders in their decision-making. Built up on developments from relevant H2020 projects, a European-scale multi-hazard platform should be designed, taking into account existing developments at EU level and available space information, in order to facilitate the identification of expected natural hazards with great specificity in time and space.

The 6th Assessment Report from Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the consequences of this warming, including the loss of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, lengthening fire seasons, increasing extreme heat events, thinning and loss of Arctic sea ice, threat of ocean acidification, and reductions in spring snow cover. The rapid and wide-scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and unprecedented risks to natural environments; social and cultural systems; economic, political and legal systems; and built environments of the Arctic and across the globe. Gaps in scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region's future. Understanding and adapting to a changing Arctic requires creative new directions for Arctic-related research, education, workforce development, and leveraging of science, engineering, and technology advances from outside the Arctic.  Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) embodies an important forward-looking response by the Foundation to these profound challenges. NNA seeks innovations in fundamental convergence research across the social, natural, environmental, computing and information sciences, and engineering that address the interactions or connections among natural and built environments and social systems, and how these connections inform our understanding of Arctic change and its local and global effects.  This solicitation requests proposals that fall within one of three tracks: NNA Incubator Grants, dedicated to developing convergent teams to carry out research projects of larger scope in the future; NNA Research Grants, aimed to support creative projects on fundamental research that address convergent scientific and engineering challenges related to the rapidly changing Arctic; and NNA Collaboratory Grants, designed to support collaborative teams undertaking research and training initiatives addressing grand challenges related to the rapidly changing New Arctic.","id":"107120","spon_name":"National Science Foundation","NextDeadlineDate":"08-Feb-2023","total_funding_limit":3000000,"programurl":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22520/nsf22520.htm","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Navigating the New Arctic (NNA) ","revision_date":"29-Oct-2021","deadline_note":"","sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=336265","deadline_date":["08-Feb-2023"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":"703-292-8030","contact_email":"nna@nsf.gov"},{"synopsis":"&nbsp;<br /><p>Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is pleased to launch this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) Annual Program Statement (APS) for opportunities to support MCC in achieving its mission of poverty reduction through economic growth.

Around 35 % of the total losses from climate and extreme and weather events are insured today in the EU, although the proportion of the insured losses ranges from 1 % in Romania and Lithuania to about 60 % in Belgium. In the near-term future, the European insurance industry and their regulators have warned that affordability and insurability are likely to become an increasing concern with climate change. Insurance, in combination with other risk transfer and financing mechanisms, is an important tool to achieve disaster risk reduction targets. Insurance plays an important role in financially supporting the recovery of individuals, organisations, businesses and communities affected by natural disasters. Large disaster losses in recent years have led insurance companies to re-examine their approach to increase the extent of insurance coverage and compensation for loss in vulnerable areas. This includes increasing their investment in assessing and modelling risk, developing advice on risk prevention and establishing new forms of coverage to support governments in managing the costs they face in post-disaster recovery. Questions remain about the limits of insurance in tackling fast-rising threats - not only how people at highest risk and with lower incomes can afford it, but whether insurance models can cope with much more frequent and destructive. Rethinking insurance pay-outs, giving homeowners clearer information on potential risks - using simple online tools, or providing data at the time of house purchases - may also be the way forward more resilient communities.</p></div>","id":"111337","spon_name":"European Commission","NextDeadlineDate":"23-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl3-2022-drs-01-06","sponsor_type":"European Union Government","prog_title":"Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 -- Improved Disaster Risk Pricing Assessment","revision_date":"23-May-2022","deadline_note":"<p>Contact the Research Enquiry Service for&nbsp;questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","sponwebsite":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null","deadline_date":["23-Nov-2022"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"See notes for contact information."},{"synopsis":"<div>Proposals are invited against the following topic: Enhanced preparedness and management of High-Impact Low-Probability or unexpected events</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><p>This topic is part of the call:&nbsp;Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 (HORIZON-CL3-2022-DRS-01)</p><p>The risk landscape has changed significantly over the last decades.

A 2019 revision of Decision 1313/2013/EU on a Union Civil Protection Mechanism has brought attention to high impact low probability risks and events, now requiring Member States to take prevention and preparedness measures to address them where appropriate, and the EU fully financing capacities through rescEU to respond to high impact low probability events.</p><p>To get the right balance between planning for specific &lsquo;known&rsquo; events and creating generic responses for events that are rare or unexpected, research should support the anticipation and management of shock events through improving planning processes, establishing broader risk-uncertainty frameworks that capture such events, enhancing business resilience and responses to shocks, and stepping up communications in a crisis.</p><p>Preparing for and managing the consequences of a HILP event will benefit firstly from developing an increased understanding of new and emerging risks, besides the required risk understanding dealt with in topics&nbsp;CL3-2021-DRS-01-01&nbsp;and&nbsp;CL3-2021-DRS-01-02, and in close connection to them. Improved methods should also be sought to support risk assessors and decision-makers in conceptualising these risks and developing no-regret options to manage them. A thorough understanding of existing risk management capacities across Europe at national and regional levels for responding to high-impact low-probability risks that Europe may face would contribute to improving preparedness at the European level to risks that can affect multiple countries at once and overwhelm national response capacities. Finally, enhancing preparedness for and management of high impact low-probability events cannot happen without an increased resilience of individuals. In close connection to topic&nbsp;CL3-2021-DRS-01-02, research is also needed on how to prepare citizens for unfamiliar risks and what information to disseminate, and how to communicate, during the disaster or crisis-related emergency in order to manage panic, confusion and threats of disinformation.</p><p>Given the practical nature of this topic, co-design, co-development, co-dissemination and co-evaluation of the research outputs engaging the intended end users will be particularly important.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.</p></div>","id":"111312","spon_name":"European Commission","NextDeadlineDate":"23-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":4950000,"programurl":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl3-2022-drs-01-02","sponsor_type":"European Union Government","prog_title":"Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 -- Enhanced Preparedness and Management of High-Impact Low-Probability or Unexpected Events","revision_date":"20-May-2022","deadline_note":"<p>Contact the Research Enquiry Service for&nbsp;questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","sponwebsite":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null","deadline_date":["23-Nov-2022"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"See notes for contact information."},{"synopsis":"<p>The annual P4CLIMATE competition supports the scientific objectives of the National Science Foundation by fostering interdisciplinary research and synthesis of climate data.</p><p>The goal of the interdisciplinary P4CLIMATE solicitation is to utilize observational and modeling studies to provide paleo perspectives addressing the two research themes:&nbsp;1) Past Regional and Seasonal Climate; and 2) Past Climate Forcing, Sensitivity, and Feedbacks.&nbsp;</p>","id":"112261","spon_name":"National Science Foundation","NextDeadlineDate":"20-Oct-2022","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://beta.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/paleo-perspectives-present-and-projected-climate-p4climate","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Paleo Perspectives on Present and Projected Climate (P4CLIMATE)","revision_date":"06-Jul-2022","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=341714","deadline_date":["20-Oct-2022"],"contact":"David J.

Besides operational cooperation, there is a need to find a common understanding on what innovation is needed to able to respond to different challenges.

These concern, in particular, ways to react and informed decisions to take in case of an event. Individual, public and multi-level actions are needed in disaster risk management and they have huge implications on potentially reducing losses and increasing the operational capacity of responders, along with significant impacts on the emergency planning and management phases and its relation to continuous operations and existing safety management. In particular, the level of awareness of EU citizens of the risks in their region is an indicator for measuring progress in increasing public awareness and preparedness for disasters and in the implementation of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism legislation.</p><p>Besides the required risk understanding dealt with in topic&nbsp;CL3-2021-DRS-01-01, research is needed in several domains. With regard to public administrations, it is relevant to conceptualise how to increase risk awareness by building processes capable of fostering a long-lasting coalition with citizens around the objective of reducing vulnerability. This implies the definition of action protocols and models of responsibility that mobilise the intervention of individual employees of public administrations. With regard to business companies and practitioners, it is relevant to integrate their emergency activities in the local context. With regard to citizens and communities, it is necessary to design preparedness actions enabling an empowerment of citizens (including particularly vulnerable groups), their communities and NGOs through bottom-up participatory and learning processes. This includes school/university curricula and professional training and trust building among local actors, integrating relevant traditional knowledge, incorporating a gender perspective where relevant, best practices, guidelines, and possible changes of regulations, to allow participatory actions. Difficulties in communication to the public in preparedness (and response) phases requires the consideration of legal aspects, along with investigations into innovative practices, forms and tools that will enable the more effective sharing of information, taking into account possible risks of disinformation and fake news. These will support citizens in acting efficiently by themselves, through enhanced collaboration and communication and improving information exchanges between local authorities (including first and second responders), vulnerable populations (e.g. socio-economic groups, ethnic groups, people with illnesses or disabilities, children, elderly, hospital patients), and the private sector.</p><p>Moreover, recent crises have shown that there is a large sense of solidarity among the population during a disaster or crisis situation. Many citizens that were not involved in disaster relief organisations before the crisis want to offer support to their fellow citizens and the broader community in times of crises. These initiatives of &ldquo;spontaneous volunteers&rdquo; are however most efficient if they are informed and trained and if their valuable contributions are coordinated with the authorities and first and second responders on the ground. Preparedness plans, tests and continued adaption on how best to manage spontaneous volunteers and integrate those into the response are needed.</p><p>This topic requires the effective contribution of SSH disciplines and the involvement of SSH experts, institutions as well as the inclusion of relevant SSH expertise, in order to produce meaningful and significant effects enhancing the societal impact of the related research activities.&nbsp;In order to achieve the expected outcomes, international cooperation is encouraged.</p></div>","id":"111311","spon_name":"European Commission","NextDeadlineDate":"23-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":4950000,"programurl":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl3-2022-drs-01-01","sponsor_type":"European Union Government","prog_title":"Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 -- Enhanced Citizen Preparedness in the Event of a Disaster or Crisis-Related Emergency","revision_date":"20-May-2022","deadline_note":"<p>Contact the Research Enquiry Service for&nbsp;questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","sponwebsite":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null","deadline_date":["23-Nov-2022"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"See notes for contact information."},{"synopsis":"<div>Proposals are invited against the following topic: Better understanding of citizens&rsquo; behavioural and psychological reactions in the event of a disaster or crisis situation</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><p>This topic is part of the call:&nbsp;Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 (HORIZON-CL3-2022-DRS-01)</p><p>Human actions and behaviour may strongly influence the effects and dynamics of a disaster or crisis situation and on the response, potentially modifying the vulnerability of the population. For example, inadequate design of technological systems may favour cascading consequences due to limited consideration of human performance, and insufficient planning. Linked to this, due to extreme time pressure, crisis managers are often forced to make decisions on the basis of inadequate information. The behaviour of the general public, mostly influenced by demographic factors (e.g. gender, age, income, education, risk-tolerance, social connectivity etc.) and the perception of risks, depends on the availability, form and access to information about the crisis and management of trade-offs (e.g. efficiency and thoroughness trade-offs). Social media play an important role here being a means of disinformation and misinformation.</p><p>Recent disasters related either to natural causes (including climate-related and geological hazards), man-made causes (including industrial accidents or terrorist attacks) or the COVID-19 pandemic crisis have shown the lack of sufficient knowledge in the way citizens react in case of disasters or crisis situations, with implications on policy design and implementation for example in the form of preparedness plans. In this respect, taking into account the knowledge gathered by projects funded in Horizon 2020 and ensuring complementarity, behavioural and psychological research on how citizens behave in the event of a disaster or crisis situation is needed to better understand how to best raise awareness in the population and develop tools to facilitate this.</p><p>It is hence necessary to better investigate how historical, cultural and emotional factors (e.g. anxiety, panic etc.) during a disaster or a crisis influence rational actions, evaluations of options and information seeking.

The soundness of decisions is based on quality data, which justifies that continuous efforts are made to improve their quality assurance / quality control, in particular in the natural hazards area as well as in the CBRN-E area. In many instances, measurement data used in decision-making are rarely challenged in the areas of crisis management and/or mechanisms are still underdeveloped to systematically demonstrate their quality (e.g. in the case of substances of criminal nature such as biological toxins). Quality assurance / Quality control (QA/QC) are prone to standardised procedures such as the EN 45000 Series, which includes requirements related to laboratory settings, analytical techniques, criteria for analytical performances (e.g. accuracy, repeatability, limits of detection etc.) that are well implemented in sectors such as the environment (including water), food and health. In other areas requiring monitoring data of physical, chemical or biological nature related to risk assessment of natural hazards such as climate threats and pandemics, man-made (accidental) risks (e.g. chemical substances in Seveso-type environments) or terrorism threats (e.g. chemical or biological toxins used for criminal purposes), the QA/QC rules are much less known and followed. In particular, the systematic comparison of measurement techniques related to risk assessment of natural hazards (including health) and CBRN-E data is not wide-spread and references data or materials are often lacking. Recent developments have led to the testing of proficiency testing schemes for biological toxins of potential bioterrorism risk, but a general framework for checking data quality and controlling laboratory and analytical technique performances (including from measurement data directly gathered in the field) does not yet exist at European level. There is hence a need to evaluate the needs for QA/QC developments in relevant areas for which physical, chemical and biological measurement data are insufficiently checked for quality, and to develop an appropriate EU-wide approach to improve and demonstrate this quality, thus ensuring a traceability and comparability of data used throughout Europe for sound risk- and evidence-based decision-making.</p></div>","id":"111316","spon_name":"European Commission","NextDeadlineDate":"23-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":4950000,"programurl":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/horizon-cl3-2022-drs-01-03","sponsor_type":"European Union Government","prog_title":"Disaster-Resilient Society 2022 -- Improved Quality Assurance / Quality Control of Data Used in Decision-Making Related to Risk Management of Natural Hazards, Accidents and CBRN Events","revision_date":"24-May-2022","deadline_note":"<p>Contact the Research Enquiry Service for&nbsp;questions about any aspect of European research in general and the EU Research Framework Programmes in particular:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/research-and-innovation/contact/research-enquiry-service_en</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p>","sponwebsite":"https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-search;callCode=null","deadline_date":["23-Nov-2022"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"See notes for contact information."},{"synopsis":"The North Pacific Research Board (NPRB) was established by the U.S. Congress to recommend marine research to the U.S. Secretary of Commerce.

Additionally, the use of large-scale data sources to study the indirect health impacts of the pandemic and subsequent social and economic changes is needed to understand the costs and benefits of various COVID-19 mitigation strategies.</span></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"106126","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"07-Sep-2022","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-MH-21-330.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Social, Behavioral, and Economic Impact of COVID-19 in Underserved and Vulnerable Populations","revision_date":"23-Aug-2021","deadline_note":"This notice applies to due dates on or after October 5, 2021 and subsequent receipt dates through September 8, 2024.&nbsp;","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["06-Feb-2024","05-Oct-2023","16-Oct-2023","05-Oct-2022","15-Feb-2023","14-Oct-2022","07-Sep-2023","05-Jun-2023","07-Feb-2023","05-Feb-2024","15-Feb-2024","05-Jun-2024","16-Jun-2023","07-Sep-2022","07-Jan-2024","05-Feb-2023","04-Oct-2022","07-May-2024","03-Oct-2023","16-Oct-2022","07-May-2023","16-Feb-2024","15-Jun-2023","16-Jun-2024","06-Jun-2023","16-Feb-2023","17-Oct-2023","07-Sep-2024","07-Jan-2023"],"contact":"Adam Haim, Ph.D.","contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"haima@mail.nih.gov"},{"synopsis":"<br /><p>The Department of Energy&rsquo;s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) on behalf of the DOE, Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency  Response (CESER) Risk Management Tools and Technologies (RMT) program, is  seeking applications under this Funding Opportunity Announcement  (Announcement) to advance cybersecurity tools and technologies specifically  designed to reduce cyber risks to energy delivery infrastructure.

How organisms respond to these rapidly changing conditions will have large consequences for the distribution of species over space and time, the integrity and the composition of natural communities, the distribution and the yield of domesticated crops and animals, and the incidence and the severity of pathogen outbreaks. Consequences such as these are already having major impacts on the world's food security, the bioeconomy, and the ecosystem services provided by living systems to humans. Developing a comprehensive understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of organismal response to climate change will improve our ability to predict and to mitigate maladaptive biological responses to rapidly changing environments and to facilitate organismal adaptation and persistence. Most climate change studies to date have lacked integration between the study of organismal mechanisms involved in the response to changing climates and eco-evolutionary approaches. This solicitation calls for proposals that integrate the study of genomic, physiological, structural, developmental, neural, or behavioral mechanisms of organismal response to climate change (ORCC) with eco-evolutionary approaches to better manage the effects of a rapidly changing climate on earth's living systems. Specific areas of emphasis include but are not limited to: integrating physiology and genomics into the next generation of species distribution models; mechanistic understanding of plastic responses to climate change; functional genomics of organismal response to climate change; the role biological interactions play in organismal responses to climate change; and improving our ability to predict how organisms will respond to climate change and the consequences these responses will have across biological scales. Proposals to the ORCC Solicitation are encouraged that build on NSF's investment in growing convergence research by developing integrative, cross-disciplinary approaches that examine the organismal mechanisms that underlie adaptive and maladaptive responses to environmental factors associated with climate change, how these responses affect fitness in changing and/or novel climates, and the genetic and evolutionary processes through which these traits originate, persist, and are transmitted across generations. Further, this solicitation encourages creative approaches to translate results of these investigations to better predict and manage effects of climate change on organisms across spatial and temporal scales and biological hierarchies. Proposals that do not bridge disciplinary components, that lack a specific focus on organismal responses to climate change, that do not relate mechanistic insights to eco-evolutionary consequences above the level of the individual, and that could normally be submitted to the \"core\" or special programs in IOS or DEB are not appropriate for submission to this solicitation.","id":"106986","spon_name":"Directorate for Biological Sciences/NSF","NextDeadlineDate":"15-Nov-2022","total_funding_limit":10000000,"programurl":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22513/nsf22513.htm","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Organismal Response to Climate Change","revision_date":"20-Oct-2021","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=336192","deadline_date":["15-Nov-2022"],"contact":"Irwin Forseth","contact_tel":"703-292-7862","contact_email":"iforseth@nsf.gov"},{"synopsis":"<span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The purpose of the ViCTER program is to use the R01 mechanism to foster and promote early-stage transdisciplinary collaborations and/or translational research efforts to address fundamental research among basic (technology and mechanism oriented), clinical (patient-oriented) and population-based researchers in the environmental health field.

Research Training Award (NCD-LIFESPAN) D43 program for institutional research training programs in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs, as defined by the World Bank classification system). Applications may be for collaborations between institutions in the U.S and an eligible LMIC or may involve just LMIC institutions if there is a previous track record of externally funded research and/or research training programs by the lead LMIC institution. The proposed institutional research training program is expected to sustainably strengthen the NCD research capacity of the LMIC institutions, and to train in-country experts to develop and conduct research on NCDs across the lifespan, with the long-range goal of developing and implementing evidence-based interventions relevant to their countries. Interdisciplinary research training that cuts across NCDs is encouraged. However, for more topical applications, the main focus of research training covered in the application must be relevant to the mission and/or &nbsp;interests of at least one of the participating NIH ICs, other than FIC, as stated by each in this FOA.
