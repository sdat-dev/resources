Thus, the goal of this NOSI is to encourage and facilitate scientific discovery for drowning prevention, specifically aimed at reducing drowning risk and improving outcomes in three primary domains.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 1: Understanding drowning disparities and developing drowning interventions to address these disparities.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Rates of drowning vary significantly. Reasons contributing to drowning risks among certain populations are multifaceted and likely related to access and exposure to water, knowledge and skills around water, and behaviors and beliefs. Research evaluating both structural and/or systemic forces which contribute to disparities in drowning risk among children, parents and communities is needed. Development of effective interventions aimed at addressing these factors as they pertain to drowning prevention is critical.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 2: Studying the effects of swim instruction on swim skills to prevent drowning.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Swim skills, which are often obtained through swim instruction, can decrease drowning risk; however tremendous variability among types and techniques of swim instruction exists. Validated measures which consistently assess swim skill efficacy to prevent drowning at differing ages and developmental abilities are lacking. Metrics which help to identify effective, quality swim instruction to prevent drowning are needed. The development of evidence-based best practices as to when and how to instruct populations most at risk for drowning (such as children of young age, of certain races/ethnicities, with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or those with linguistic or cultural differences), is essential.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 3: The adoption, integration and sustainable scale-up of the drowning chain of survival.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The five steps of drowning chain of survival can reduce drowning mortality. These steps include: (1) preventing drowning, (2) recognizing distress, (3) providing flotation, (4) removal from water and (5) providing care as needed. Depending on the water source, interventions which constitute these layers of drowning protection exist. Research to advance the adoption, integration and sustainable scale-up of evidence-based drowning prevention interventions and the drowning chain of survival across families and communities is needed.</span></p><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"109066","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"07-Jan-2023","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-21-048.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Research on Drowning Prevention","revision_date":"16-Feb-2022","deadline_note":"This notice applies to due dates on or after June 5, 2022 and subsequent receipt dates through May 8, 2024.&nbsp;","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["16-Jun-2023","12-Jun-2023","16-Feb-2024","05-Oct-2023","07-Jan-2024","05-Feb-2024","12-Oct-2023","07-Jan-2023","07-May-2023","07-May-2024","05-Jun-2023","05-Feb-2023","07-Sep-2023","12-Feb-2024","12-Feb-2023","16-Feb-2023","16-Oct-2023"],"contact":"Cinnamon A.

The recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is not an anomaly and will most likely not be the last virus occurrence. Today, infectious diseases are emerging and reemerging more quickly than ever before. In the last four-five years alone, two viral infections, one caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the other caused by a SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19), have spread world-wide, resulting in death, severe disease with yet, unknown, long-term morbidities., or severe birth defects to the new-born. Both ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infections may affect male and/or female reproductive systems in addition to other non-reproductive sites. Therefore, it becomes essential to investigate possible effects of emerging viruses on reproductive tissues and cells to better understand potential impacts on fertility that may be sex specific.</span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"099263","spon_name":"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/NIH/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"05-Feb-2023","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-20-021.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Emerging Viral Infections and their Impact on the Male and Female Reproductive Tract","revision_date":"02-Sep-2020","deadline_note":"<span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\">This notice applies to due dates on or after October 5, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through July 16, 2023.&nbsp;</span>","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["05-Jun-2023","16-Feb-2023","16-Jun-2023","05-Feb-2023"],"contact":"Stuart B.

Primary care practices range in size, resources and patient health needs; proposed strategies should meet the practice needs to be feasible, scalable, sustainable, and practice-ready. NIMH encourages prevention approaches that incorporate the use of mHealth (the use of mobile and wireless devices [cell phones, tablets, etc.]) and other design features that can facilitate scalability and sustainability, and deployment-focused research approaches that take into account the perspectives of key stakeholders (e.g., patients, providers, administrators) and system-level factors such as setting resources, workforce capacity, and training needs. This FOA also encourages studies that examine suicide prevention strategies that have broad reach, including potential for addressing risk among individuals who experience mental health service disparities (e.g., racial/ethnic minority groups; sexual and gender minorities, individuals living in rural areas, socioeconomically disadvantaged persons), and studies that explore how the proposed strategies can reduce health disparities and promote health equity.</span>","id":"106865","spon_name":"National Institute of Mental Health/NIH/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"22-Jan-2023 [Optional] [LOI/Pre-App]","total_funding_limit":450000,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-MH-22-120.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"RFA-MH-22-120 -- Pilot Practice-based Research for Primary Care Suicide Prevention (R34 Clinical Trial Optional)","revision_date":"26-Jan-2022","deadline_note":"<p>Applications submitted in response to this announcement must be submitted electronically either through Grants.gov, using the SF424 Research and Related (R&amp;R) forms and SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide, through the NIH Application Submission System &amp; Interface for Submission Tracking (ASSIST), or through qualified institutional system-to-system submission systems.

Further, because this field can reveal unexpected associations through analysis of diverse data, BDS approaches may reveal events that are unseen or transient in traditional analysis of datasets.

Studies may include shared mechanisms, and assessments of interactions between risk factors and interventions that address MCCs at different periods of the lifespan in diverse populations. Use of innovative technologies to assess and intervene on risk factors and pathways are encouraged. Studies may also include those that make use of existing data and/or data linkages to explore new research questions that may be helpful in understanding the impact of mechanisms in isolation or in combination.
