Reasons contributing to drowning risks among certain populations are multifaceted and likely related to access and exposure to water, knowledge and skills around water, and behaviors and beliefs. Research evaluating both structural and/or systemic forces which contribute to disparities in drowning risk among children, parents and communities is needed. Development of effective interventions aimed at addressing these factors as they pertain to drowning prevention is critical.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 2: Studying the effects of swim instruction on swim skills to prevent drowning.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Swim skills, which are often obtained through swim instruction, can decrease drowning risk; however tremendous variability among types and techniques of swim instruction exists. Validated measures which consistently assess swim skill efficacy to prevent drowning at differing ages and developmental abilities are lacking. Metrics which help to identify effective, quality swim instruction to prevent drowning are needed. The development of evidence-based best practices as to when and how to instruct populations most at risk for drowning (such as children of young age, of certain races/ethnicities, with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or those with linguistic or cultural differences), is essential.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\"><em>Domain 3: The adoption, integration and sustainable scale-up of the drowning chain of survival.</em></span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">The five steps of drowning chain of survival can reduce drowning mortality. These steps include: (1) preventing drowning, (2) recognizing distress, (3) providing flotation, (4) removal from water and (5) providing care as needed.

Pain, heavy menstrual bleeding, irregular menstrual cycles, and other symptoms associated with gynecologic disorders are often overlooked and not addressed, causing women to feel unheard. Endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS increase the risk of pregnancy complications and adverse maternal health outcomes including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa, and preterm birth. Additionally, women with endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS are more likely to have a cesarean delivery. Therefore, addressing common conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, and PCOS during the preconception (i.e., during the reproductive&nbsp; years) and interconception (i.e., between pregnancies) time periods is essential to optimizing maternal health outcomes.","id":"110821","spon_name":"Assistant Secretary for Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"07-Jul-2022","total_funding_limit":300000,"programurl":"https://www.grantsolutions.gov/gs/preaward/previewPublicAnnouncement.do?id=96144","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Improving Maternal Health through Addressing Endometriosis, Fibroids, and/or Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","revision_date":"02-May-2022","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=335046","deadline_date":["07-Jul-2022"],"contact":"Linda Stella","contact_tel":"202-690-7650","contact_email":"linda.stella@hhs.gov"},{"synopsis":"<p>The Commonwealth Fund carries out its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://commonwealthstg.prod.acquia-sites.com/about-us\">mission</a>&nbsp;by supporting independent research on health care issues and making grants to improve health care practice and policy.</p>","id":"000667","spon_name":"Commonwealth Fund","NextDeadlineDate":null,"total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/2021-07/GrantProposalGuidelines_July2021_v2.pdf","sponsor_type":"Non-Profit Organizations","prog_title":"Grants Program","revision_date":"04-Apr-2022","deadline_note":"Applicants should submit a letter of inquiry.&nbsp; LOIs are accepted on a rolling basis.&nbsp;Typically, projects recommended for board approval are in development for a few months before a funding decision.

The recent global outbreak of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is not an anomaly and will most likely not be the last virus occurrence. Today, infectious diseases are emerging and reemerging more quickly than ever before. In the last four-five years alone, two viral infections, one caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and the other caused by a SARS-CoV-2 (Covid19), have spread world-wide, resulting in death, severe disease with yet, unknown, long-term morbidities., or severe birth defects to the new-born. Both ZIKV and SARS-CoV-2 infections may affect male and/or female reproductive systems in addition to other non-reproductive sites. Therefore, it becomes essential to investigate possible effects of emerging viruses on reproductive tissues and cells to better understand potential impacts on fertility that may be sex specific.</span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"099263","spon_name":"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development/NIH/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"16-Jun-2022","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-HD-20-021.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Emerging Viral Infections and their Impact on the Male and Female Reproductive Tract","revision_date":"02-Sep-2020","deadline_note":"<span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\">This notice applies to due dates on or after October 5, 2020 and subsequent receipt dates through July 16, 2023.&nbsp;</span>","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["16-Jun-2022","05-Oct-2022","16-Oct-2022","05-Feb-2023","16-Feb-2023","05-Jun-2023","16-Jun-2023"],"contact":"Stuart B.

Intervention research supported by this initiative should be designed to study: (1) mechanisms or pathways that prevent MCCs, including the identification of early biomarkers, behavioral pathways, and individual and contextual risk factors and interactions that contribute to the development of common MCCs; (2) targeted therapies and management, including self-management, of MCCs to delay progression and prevent onset of new diseases; and (3) innovative health care partnership models for managing or treating MCCs. Studies may include shared mechanisms, and assessments of interactions between risk factors and interventions that address MCCs at different periods of the lifespan in diverse populations. Use of innovative technologies to assess and intervene on risk factors and pathways are encouraged. Studies may also include those that make use of existing data and/or data linkages to explore new research questions that may be helpful in understanding the impact of mechanisms in isolation or in combination.
