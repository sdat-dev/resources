While recent progress has been made in the molecular profiling of bladder cancers and identification of mutated genes, relatively little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms driving initiation, progression and malignancy of bladder cancer. Furthermore, our understanding of the biological processes of the normal bladder at the molecular, cell and organ levels is limited.

This study is part of the NIH&rsquo;s Helping to End Addiction Long-term (HEAL) initiative to speed scientific solutions to the national opioid public health crisis. The NIH HEAL Initiative bolsters research across NIH to (1) improve treatment for opioid misuse and addiction and (2) enhance pain management. More information about the HEAL Initiative is available at:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nih.gov/research-training/medical-research-initiatives/heal-initiative\">https://heal.nih.gov/</a>&nbsp;This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) seeks research applications to develop quantitative measures of myofascial tissues and assess their abilities to detect changes to myofascial tissues across a variety of pain management interventions. Candidate objective measures may be based on minimally invasive imaging technologies, electrophysiological recordings, integration of multiparametric imaging and electrophysiology approaches, or their integration with other markers (e.g.<em>,</em>&nbsp;immune factors, genomic markers, physiological factors) through multiscale modeling or machine learning analysis. The first phase, funded by the R61, will provide funding for up to 3 years to develop quantitative measures that can differentiate abnormal myofascial tissue from healthy tissues using cross-sectional correlations with clinical signs/symptoms. In addition, the R61 phase should include planning activities for the R33 phase. The second phase, funded under the R33, will provide support to assess the abilities of the quantitative measures developed in the R61 phase to measure tissue changes in response to therapies or manipulations that may relieve pain using rigorous, longitudinal clinical study design.&nbsp; The combined R61/R33 should not exceed 5 years. Transition from the R61 to the R33 phase of the award will be administratively reviewed and will be determined based on successful completion of &ldquo;Transition Milestones&rdquo; that need to be clearly specified in the R61 phase application.</span></span>","id":"119154","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"18-Oct-2023","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-AT-24-003.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"RFA-AT-24-003 -- HEAL Initiative: Toward Developing Quantitative Imaging and Other Relevant Biomarkers of Myofascial Tissues for Clinical Pain Management (R61/R33, Clinical Trial Required)","revision_date":"15-Jun-2023","deadline_note":"<p>Applications submitted in response to this announcement must be submitted electronically either through Grants.gov, using the SF424 Research and Related (R&amp;R) forms and SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide, through the NIH Application Submission System &amp; Interface for Submission Tracking (ASSIST), or through qualified institutional system-to-system submission systems.

Once more, the participating Institutes and Centers (ICs) are inviting supplement applications to take advantage of this opportunity to support the value of their projects, consistent with the previously peer-reviewed objectives. Therefore, as administrative supplements, the work proposed must be within the scope of the research or training that is already supported in order to be considered for funding. Active awards with project end dates in fiscal year (FY) 2025 or later are eligible. The award may not be in a terminal no-cost extension or going into a no-cost extension in FY 2024. Please note that a few ICs limit no-cost extensions in the final non-competing year of an award. For that reason, it is important to contact staff at the IC supporting the award when planning the request.</span></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span><span style=\"color:#333333;font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;background-color:#ffffff;\"></span>","id":"119455","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"02-Oct-2023","total_funding_limit":250000,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-AG-23-032.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Administrative Supplement Program to Help Develop Alzheimer’s-Focused NIH Grants","revision_date":"23-Jun-2023","deadline_note":"Application Due Date(s) &ndash; October 2, 2023 by 5:00 PM local time of applicant organization.","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["02-Oct-2023"],"contact":null,"contact_tel":null,"contact_email":null},{"synopsis":"<p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">The goal of this Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) is to support doctoral candidates from a variety of academic disciplines for up to two years for the completion of the doctoral dissertation research project.

Intervention research supported by this initiative should be designed to study: (1) mechanisms or pathways that prevent MCCs, including the identification of early biomarkers, behavioral pathways, and individual and contextual risk factors and interactions that contribute to the development of common MCCs; (2) targeted therapies and management, including self-management, of MCCs to delay progression and prevent onset of new diseases; and (3) innovative health care partnership models for managing or treating MCCs. Studies may include shared mechanisms, and assessments of interactions between risk factors and interventions that address MCCs at different periods of the lifespan in diverse populations. Use of innovative technologies to assess and intervene on risk factors and pathways are encouraged. Studies may also include those that make use of existing data and/or data linkages to explore new research questions that may be helpful in understanding the impact of mechanisms in isolation or in combination. Of particular interest are interventions that target prevention and treatment of multiple chronic health conditions, including study designs that address therapeutic targets for preventing co-occurring MCCs.</span></p><p class=\"Normal\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;margin-bottom:10px;color:#333333;font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.6px;background-color:#ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">Prospective applicants whose research interests relate to developing improved measures and methods for understanding multimorbidity, including but not limited to measures/tools to support basic mechanistic discovery of shared MCC pathways and identification and initial evaluation of MCC shared signatures, should see&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-179.html\" style=\"box-sizing:border-box;color:#428bca;text-decoration-line:none;\"><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">PAR-20-179.</span></a></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;font-size:small;\">&nbsp;</span></p>","id":"093638","spon_name":"National Institutes of Health/DHHS","NextDeadlineDate":"05-Oct-2023","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-180.html","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Identifying Innovative Mechanisms or Interventions that Target Multimorbidity and Its Consequences (R01 Clinical Trial Optional)","revision_date":"01-Dec-2022","deadline_note":"Applications submitted in response to this announcement must be submitted electronically either through Grants.gov, using the SF424 Research and Related (R&amp;R) forms and SF424 (R&amp;R) Application Guide, through the NIH Application Submission System &amp; Interface for Submission Tracking (ASSIST), or through qualified institutional system-to-system submission systems.
