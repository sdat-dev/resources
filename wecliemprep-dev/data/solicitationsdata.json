The CAP program supports sustained, collaborative relationships that help communities build lasting and equitable climate resilience. Funded by 5-year cooperative agreements with NOAA, the work is accomplished by teams of research institutions, nonprofit organizations, and state/local/Tribal governments in multi-state regions. CAP teams engage in a variety of applied and co-developed research and partnerships with communities. A central tenet of the CAP program is that learning about climate adaptation and resilience is facilitated by and sustained across a wide range of experts, practitioners, and the public. Learning about and doing adaptation happens within social contexts. As such, the CAP program supports networks of people working together to plan for and adjust to change using science and local knowledge.","id":"121480","spon_name":"National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration/Department of Commerce","NextDeadlineDate":"05-Feb-2024","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=350256","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Climate Program Office (CPO), Climate Adaptation Partnerships Program FY2024","revision_date":"21-Sep-2023","deadline_note":"<div><p>Letters of intent (LOIs) should be received by email by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 30, 2023.</p><p>Full applications must be received by 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time, on February 5, 2024.</p></div>","sponwebsite":null,"deadline_date":["05-Feb-2024"],"contact":"Diane Brown","contact_tel":null,"contact_email":"diane.brown@noaa.gov"},{"synopsis":"The purpose of this notice is to solicit grant proposals from National Estuarine Research Reserves (NERRS or Reserves) for coastal habitat restoration; costal habitat restoration planning, engineering, and design; and land conservation projects that support the goals and inter of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA), the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation Program (CELCP), and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Public Law 117-58.

Track A for CIVIC is centered on pre-disaster action around adaptation, mitigation, and resilience in community systems, services, and economic drivers that are vulnerable in the face of a changing climate. Track B is centered on enhancing peoples&rsquo; access to essential resources and services&mdash;through efforts at the level of communities&mdash;where better accessibility could significantly improve quality of life and community resilience. This DCL is aligned with ongoing collaborative support from NSF and USDA/NIFA for foundational and applied research at the intersection of computational, engineering, agricultural, and social sciences. The CIVIC program is designed to build on these efforts through its support for pilot projects that transition foundational advancements in areas such as automation and artificial intelligence into transformative, research-driven solutions addressing local community challenges. Additionally, CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, with communities identifying civic priorities ripe for innovation and then partnering with researchers to address those priorities.

In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to microbes and their diverse capabilities for bio-remediation and applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. Because of advances in molecular biology, synthetic biology and bioengineering, researchers now have the ability to assemble synthetic microbial communities that have novel compositions, genetics and phenotypes and to use these communities to address both fundamental biological questions and a range of societal problems. The goal of this solicitation is to support research that addresses one or more of the three themes: 1) define the underlying mechanisms or rules that drive the formation, maintenance or evolution of synthetic microbial communities, 2) use synthetic microbial communities to address fundamental biological questions, including questions in molecular biology, cellular/organismal biology, ecology and evolution and/or 3) build synthetic communities with biotechnology, bio-economy or environmental engineering applications, including but not limited to the production of novel bio-renewable chemicals, bio-degradation of recalcitrant or \"forever chemicals,\" enabling a circular bio-economy, fostering sustainable agriculture and mitigating the impacts of climate change. For theme 3, the emphasis should be on designing communities with novel capabilities and understanding the underlying mechanisms that lead to these novel capabilities.","id":"112105","spon_name":"Directorate for Biological Sciences/NSF","NextDeadlineDate":"01-Aug-2024","total_funding_limit":0,"programurl":"https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/building-synthetic-microbial-communities-biology","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"Building Synthetic Microbial Communities for Biology, Mitigating Climate Change, Sustainability and Biotechnology","revision_date":"27-Jun-2023","deadline_note":null,"sponwebsite":"https://www.grants.gov/web/grants/view-opportunity.html?oppId=341405","deadline_date":["01-Aug-2024"],"contact":"Anthony G.

NIOSH conducts and funds scientific research, develops methods to prevent occupational hazards, develops guidance and authoritative recommendations, translates scientific knowledge into products and services, disseminates information, identifies factors underlying work-related disease and injury, and responds to requests for workplace health hazard evaluations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">NIOSH has an extensive history of conducting research to understand and to reduce hazards in the commercial fishing industry. This research has largely been conducted in close collaboration with crews, industry and the US Coast Guard.

CCIs integrate research with strong broader impacts, including innovation, education, broadening participation, and informal science communication. The CCI Program is a two-phase program. Both phases are described in this solicitation. Phase I CCIs receive significant resources to develop the science, management and broader impacts of a major research center before requesting Phase II funding. Satisfactory progress in Phase I is required for Phase II applications; Phase I proposals funded in FY 2024 will seek Phase II funding in FY 2027.
