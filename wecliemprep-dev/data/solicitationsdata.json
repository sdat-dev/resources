Additionally, CIVIC flips the community-university dynamic, with communities identifying civic priorities ripe for innovation and then partnering with researchers to address those priorities.

Given their relative importance to ecosystems around the world, to the economy and to health, researchers have studied microbial systems extensively and have a better understanding of their capabilities and impacts on hosts and the environment. In recent years, researchers have increasingly turned to microbes and their diverse capabilities for bio-remediation and applications in biotechnology, agriculture, and medicine. Because of advances in molecular biology, synthetic biology and bioengineering, researchers now have the ability to assemble synthetic microbial communities that have novel compositions, genetics and phenotypes and to use these communities to address both fundamental biological questions and a range of societal problems. The goal of this solicitation is to support research that addresses one or more of the three themes: 1) define the underlying mechanisms or rules that drive the formation, maintenance or evolution of synthetic microbial communities, 2) use synthetic microbial communities to address fundamental biological questions, including questions in molecular biology, cellular/organismal biology, ecology and evolution and/or 3) build synthetic communities with biotechnology, bio-economy or environmental engineering applications, including but not limited to the production of novel bio-renewable chemicals, bio-degradation of recalcitrant or \"forever chemicals,\" enabling a circular bio-economy, fostering sustainable agriculture and mitigating the impacts of climate change.

The 6th Assessment Report from Working Group 1 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the consequences of this warming, including the loss of mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet, lengthening fire seasons, increasing extreme heat events, thinning and loss of Arctic sea ice, threat of ocean acidification, and reductions in spring snow cover. The rapid and wide-scale changes occurring in response to this warming portend new opportunities and unprecedented risks to natural environments; social and cultural systems; economic, political and legal systems; and built environments of the Arctic and across the globe. Gaps in scientific observations and the prevalence of interdependent social, natural, and built systems in the Arctic make it challenging to predict the region's future.

NSF EPSCoR eligibility is based on a jurisdiction's recent five-year history of total funds awarded by NSF relative to the Foundation's total research budget for that same period. Through this program, NSF establishes partnerships with government, higher education, and industry that are designed to affect sustainable improvements in a jurisdiction's research infrastructure, Research and Development (R&amp;D) capacity, and hence, its R&amp;D competitiveness.  RII Track-2 FEC builds interjurisdictional collaborative teams of EPSCoR investigators in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) focus areas consistent with the National Science Foundation 2022-2026 Strategic Plan. Projects are investigator-driven and must include researchers from at least two EPSCoR eligible jurisdictions with complementary expertise and resources necessary to address challenges, which neither party could address as well or rapidly independently. RII Track-2 FEC projects have a comprehensive and integrated vision to drive discovery and build sustainable STEM capacity that exemplifies individual, institutional, geographic, and disciplinary diversity. Additionally, the projects' STEM research and education activities seek to broaden participation through the strategic inclusion and integration of diverse individuals, institutions, and sectors. In addition, NSF EPSCoR recognizes that the development of early-career faculty from backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields is critical to sustaining and advancing research capacity. The integration and inclusion of Minority-serving Institutions (MSIs), women's colleges, Primarily Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs), and two-year colleges is a critical component of this sustainable STEM capacity.&nbsp;For FY 2023/2024, the topical focus area of RII Track-2 FEC is: \"advancing climate change research and resilience capacity to expand opportunities for disproportionately affected communities.\"","id":"113375","spon_name":"Office of Integrative Activities/NSF","NextDeadlineDate":"29-Dec-2022 [LOI/Pre-App]","total_funding_limit":6000000,"programurl":"https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2022/nsf22633/nsf22633.htm","sponsor_type":"US Federal","prog_title":"EPSCoR Research Infrastructure Improvement Program: Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaborations (RII Track-2 FEC)","revision_date":"20-Sep-2022","deadline_note":"Letters of intent are required and are due December 20, 2022.

NIOSH conducts and funds scientific research, develops methods to prevent occupational hazards, develops guidance and authoritative recommendations, translates scientific knowledge into products and services, disseminates information, identifies factors underlying work-related disease and injury, and responds to requests for workplace health hazard evaluations.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:small;\">NIOSH has an extensive history of conducting research to understand and to reduce hazards in the commercial fishing industry.

As NSF seeks to support the development of technologies in such fields, similar support will be needed to foster and grow a diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce to contribute to such innovation. Large scale societal challenges like climate change and clean energy also require a STEM workforce that brings varied perspectives and expertise to further accelerate the translation of science and engineering discoveries into large-scale solutions. Moreover, as current and new emerging technologies continue to evolve, unforeseen issues around security, safety and privacy will impact the preparation of the workforce. Emerging technologies are also dynamic and rapidly changing, with career entry and advancement often requiring \"learning-by-doing\" experience, even for those with some STEM education.
