In business, Mr. Turetsky served as a senior officer of a telecommunications services start-up that he helped to grow and bring public; and twice served as Management Trustee while in private law practice, appointed by federal courts on the recommendation of the Bush Department of Justice, to manage all aspects of mobile wireless service businesses in a total of 20 mostly rural markets under merger consent decrees until those businesses were divested (about 6 months each time). In the Clinton Administration, Mr. Turetsky served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust in the U.S. Department of Justice, with special responsibility for competition enforcement and policy issues affecting regulated industries, in the U.S. and abroad.\n\nMr. Turetsky has a J.D. from the University of Chicago School of Law, studied at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and has a B.A., magna cum laude, from Amherst College.
