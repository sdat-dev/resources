I work on a variety of multiscale (time and space) research problems that relate to the weather and climate of higher- and middle-latitude regions as well as the tropics. Research problems that involve winter storms, hurricanes, organized convective systems and the predictability of individual flow regimes are especially attractive to me. I am especially interested in problems at the weather-climate interface. I am also interested in the weather analysis and forecasting process including forecast verification studies and the measurement and assessment of forecaster skill. My forecast-related activities have stimulated me to pursue numerous synoptic-dynamic research opportunities with my graduate and undergraduate students that have resulted in refereed publications. I like to collaborate on research projects with other University at Albany faculty members in the synoptic-dynamic group and with colleagues at other institutions. Recent external collaborators include Chris Davis and Morris Weisman at NCAR, and Ron McTaggart-Cowan at the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC).\n\nI have external research support, joint with Professor Daniel Keyser, from the National Science Foundation (NSF) for &quot;Phenomenological Studies of Cool-Season Extreme Weather Events over Central and Eastern North America on Intraseasonal Time Scales.&quot; This NSF grant was received in 2014 and is funded for three years.  I also have funding from the NSF for &quot;High Plains Convection&#58; Diurnally Varying Mesoscale-Synoptic Scale Interactions over Complex Terrain during the Mesoscale Predictability Experiment (MPEX).&quot; This grant will run through late 2016 with an approved supplement and no-cost extension.  Support may exist for one new graduate student on these NSF grants beginning in September 2015.\n\nAdditional research support is provided by the NOAA/NWS/CSTAR program as part of a joint University at Albany and NWS cooperative research effort targeted at improving the prediction of warm- and cool-season heavy precipitation events over the northeastern US. This CSTAR-supported research effort, for which Prof. Kristen Corbosiero is the PI and I am one of the five Co-PIs, is conducted in close collaboration with a number of NWS offices in the northeastern U.S. and is funded into 2017. As a part of this research effort, I have also established a close working relationship with staff members of the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) in Norman, Oklahoma, centered on understanding the scientific challenges of organized convective storm development and severe weather forecasting. This cooperative effort has enabled me to participate with several of my graduate students in the annual SPC Spring Forecasting Experiment (SFE).  I have been participating in the SFE, which is a part of the NOAA testbed, with my graduate students from 2004 to the present. \n\nI am also a Co-Investigator on a NOAA Project led by Altug Aksoy and Jason Dunion entitled &quot;Using NOAA UAS Assets and OSSE/DA Capabilities to Improve Sampling Strategies and Numerical Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Track, Intensity, and Structure.&quot;  This project is funded from 1 June 2014 to 31 May 2017.  This project will be able to support any new graduate students.\n\nI am the PI, and Professor Daniel Keyser is the Co-PI on a NOAA-NCEP-WPC proposal that was funded in May 2015 to investigate how to improve the probabilistic forecasting of extreme temperature and precipitation events in the 8-10 day time range.  This funded proposal currently supports a full-time postdoctoral research associate (Dr. Andrew C. Winters). Funding is not available to support a new graduate student.\n\nI am a co-investigator on an NSF proposal in the program for Partnerships for International Research and Education (PIRE). The project is entitled “Building Extreme Weather Resiliency Through Improved Weather and Climate Prediction and Response Strategies.” The project is led by ASRC Director Dr. Everette Joseph and was funded in September 2015. I will work with co-principal investigator Christopher Thorncroft. We will focus on case studies and composite analyses of terrain-influenced extreme rainfall events in the northeastern U.S. and Taiwan. This project supports two existing graduate students.\n\nI am a Co-PI, along with Co-PI John R. Gyakum (McGill University), on a two-year NOAA-funded proposal led by Dr. Raul Roebber (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee), entitled “Improving Prediction of Large-scale regime changes.” This grant began in September 2016 and will support one existing graduate student.\n\nI have a proposal pending with the NSF entitled “Impacts of Rossby wave breaking and potential vorticity streamer formation on the environment of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic.” This proposal, if funded (decision expected by late winter 2017), might be able to support one new graduate student for the 2017–2018 academic year.\n\n…………………………\n\nMy current research projects focus on observational and modeling studies of synoptic and mesoscale phenomena from a multiscale perspective. Specifically, I work with my students on a variety of research projects that seek to&#58; (1) understand the physical processes governing the tropical transition (TT) and extratropical transition (ET) of tropical cyclones (TCs), (2) deduce what physical processes control the evolution and distribution of heavy precipitation associated with landfalling TCs, (3) understand what physical processes govern the TT of cold-core baroclinic systems to warm-core TCs through real-data diagnostic analysis and numerical simulations, (4) document the structure and life cycles of continental and oceanic cyclones and anticyclones with emphasis on polar-midlatitude interactions and explore the extent to which large-scale circulation patterns (e.g., the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern) control the extent and structure of these storms, (5) investigate extreme weather events at the weather-climate interface that significantly impact intraseasonal variability, (6) investigate arctic-midlatitude interactions motivated by the ongoing and accelerating loss of Arctic Ocean sea ice, (7) explore how cutoff cyclones trigger damaging heavy precipitation events, (8) deduce the physical processes that control the evolution of mesoscale substructure within cyclones, (9) conduct detailed analyses of the structure and life cycle of challenging to forecast warm season mesoscale convective weather systems across the U.S., (10) define the environmental conditions associated with a spectrum of severe weather in the northeastern US and determine the impact of regional physiography on storm structure and evolution, and (11) document the nature of convection-dominated warm season heavy precipitation and stratiform-dominated cool season heavy precipitation events in the northeastern US. To the extent possible, the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) model will be used to conduct real-data numerical simulations that are designed to test physical hypotheses for storm development formulated from the diagnostic analysis of these events.\n\nI like to work with graduate students individually or cooperatively with other faculty members on a variety of research problems. Student interests can often dictate new research opportunities and directions. I also like to work with undergraduate students on research projects designed to stimulate their interest in atmospheric science.</div>","CV":"","ResearchGate":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lance-Bosart","GoogleScholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7ZyUZFUAAAAJ&hl=en","Others":"","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences","InstitutionalPage":"https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/lance-f-bosart","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"College of Arts and Sciences","Photopath":"lbosart@albany.edu.jpg"},{"Title":"Dr.","Email":"kcorbosiero@albany.edu","LastName":"Corbosiero","FirstName":"Kristen","PhoneNumber":"518-442-5852","JobTitle":"Associate Professor","Keyword1":"","Keyword2":"","Keyword3":"","Keyword4":"","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"<div class=\"ExternalClass3991F9AE3BE94FBAAB02D1FD77F95153\">Dr. Kristen L.

Errors can originate from two primary sources&#58; the model initial conditions (i.e., the analysis), or errors in the model formulation (i.e., model error). Initial conditions for NWP models are generated via data assimilation, whereby new observation information is incorporated into a model's short-term forecast to produce a best estimate of the atmospheric state. Improvements to the initial conditions can be achieved by either adjusting how observations impact the model state, or taking observations in regions where forecast errors quickly grow.\n\nMy research focuses on trying to understand atmospheric predictability by determining the source and growth of errors within numerical models across a number of timescales using ensemble forecasts.

I am particularly interested in trying to bridge the gap between modern climate dynamics studies and paleoclimatic interpretation of proxy data. Therefore my research is very interdisciplinary in nature and often forms part of larger international collaborative programs. In my research I tend to focus on two regions in particular&#58; the tropical and subtropical Andes in South America and the mountains of East Africa. In both locations a wealth of paleoclimatic information is available from a large number of natural archives, but the understanding of their climatic sensitivity is often inadequate. Some of the most important natural archives are based on stable isotopic proxies (e.g. tropical ice cores, speleothems or biomarkers in lake sediments), but it is often not clear what these proxies really record and what their climatic sensitivities are in both the time- and space domain. I try to investigate how these sensitivities may change in time as boundary conditions change and if lessons learned from climate studies on interannual to interdecadal timescales can be used in the interpretation of centennial to millennial scale climate variability recorded in these proxies. To answer some of these questions I employ both observational data (in-situ measurements, reanalysis, radiosonde and satellite data) and models of varying complexity (GCMs, RCMs and isotopic models). In the past this research has been funded through grants from NSF (Earth System History, Paleoclimate and Climate Dynamics) and NOAA (Climate Change Data and Detection, CCDD).\n\nI also maintain an active research program studying the causes, impacts and scenarios of future climate change in the tropical Andes, where the retreat of glaciers may soon pose a threat for the regional water supply. I employ regional climate models (RCMs) over the tropical Andes to study how glacier extent and runoff from glacierized catchments will change under different scenarios as predicted in the IPCC-SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios). This research is funded through NSF (co-funded by Hydrology and Climate Dynamics Divisions) and the Inter-American Institute for Global Change Research (IAI). I am also collaborating with the Latin America Division of the Word Bank, which has a particular interest in this kind of research and funding through the Global Environmental Fund (GEF) to implement adaptation measures in several Andean countries.</div>","CV":"","ResearchGate":"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mathias-Vuille","GoogleScholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_jEE_zgAAAAJ&hl=en","Others":"http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/mathias/","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences","InstitutionalPage":"https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/mathias-vuille","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"College of Arts and Sciences","Photopath":"mvuille@albany.edu.jpg"},{"Title":"Dr.","Email":"jwang20@albany.edu","LastName":"Wang","FirstName":"Junhong","PhoneNumber":"518-442-6389","JobTitle":"Research Associate Professor","Keyword1":"Climate observations, data creation and analysis","Keyword2":"Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) measurements and applications","Keyword3":"Sounding technology and data quality","Keyword4":"","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"","CV":"https://www.albany.edu/sites/default/files/resumes/Junhong_CV.pdf","ResearchGate":"https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Junhong-Wang-2066849917","GoogleScholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VczAYEMAAAAJ&hl=en","Others":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37292905700","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES RESEARCH CENTER","InstitutionalPage":"https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/junhong-june-wang","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"University-wide Research Center","Photopath":"jwang20@albany.edu.jpg"},{"Title":"Dr.","Email":"lzhou@albany.edu","LastName":"Zhou","FirstName":"Liming","PhoneNumber":"518-442-4446","JobTitle":"Professor","Keyword1":"Land-atmosphere/climate interaction","Keyword2":"land-surface remote sensing","Keyword3":"land-surface modeling","Keyword4":"climate modeling","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"<div class=\"ExternalClass0E0F24A2CF9C498EB4B852C9DD98B5F2\">Broadly trained as a physical geographer and a meteorologist, I have a strong interest in interdisciplinary research related to land-human-climate interactions, and aim at improving our understanding of the processes, coupling, interactions, feedbacks and teleconnections in the land-atmosphere interface from the perspectives of remote sensing, weather and climate. For example, I would like to investigate how changes in land surface modify local, regional and global climate and hydrology at diurnal, seasonal, and longer time scales, and how climate changes affect ecosystems, land surface processes, and our human systems.\n\nI find it very exciting in using various remote sensed products in weather, climate, and environmental sciences to identify weather and climate model deficiencies in land and atmospheric processes and to improve model’s forecast and simulation capabilities. I am also fascinated with climate change associated with changes in land surface. I examine extensively changes in spatiotemporal patterns and magnitude in key hydro-climate variables from observations and model outputs. I combine some unique methods and techniques such as quantitative analyses (e.g., time series analysis, statistical and geospatial methods) of observational and remote sensing/GIS data with physical modeling of land-climate processes (e.g., via regional and global models). I am extending my research into the human dimension of land-climate interactions, focusing on quantifying and projecting social-economic consequences of climatic change and impacts of human activities on our ecosystems, weather and climate systems.\n\nMy studies have produced some important and interesting results, among which are the findings of warming-enhanced greening and biomass increases and lengthening in growing season in northern mid- to high-latitudes, drought-induced vegetation browning in the Congo rainforests, turbine- induced local nighttime warming over larges wind farms in U.S., urbanization-induced significant regional climate effects in China, desert amplification in a warming climate, the asymmetric diurnal warming of drought on maximum/minimum temperatures, an inverse linear relationship between albedo and emissivity over barren soils in North Africa, and the fingerprint of anthropogenic signals in observed and multi-model simulated extreme temperatures.\n\nThe overarching objective of my research is to advance our understanding of land-human-climate interactions through a synthetic analysis of surface observations and remotely sensed and GIS data with Earth system modeling. To be specific, I will use satellite and GIS data, in situ observations and economic/societal information, and Earth system models to understand physical processes/mechanisms and interactions of land-human-climate systems, and to improve our model capability to predict climate change and assess its impacts and consequence on our environment, currently, and in the future. Land surface processes related to vegetation dynamics, deforestation, afforestation, irrigation, fires, urbanization, desertification, and renewable energy are my emphases.</div>","CV":"https://www.albany.edu/sites/default/files/resumes/limingzhou_cv.pdf","ResearchGate":"https://www.researchgate.net/lab/Liming-Zhou-Lab-2","GoogleScholar":"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=E8dU9A4AAAAJ&hl=en","Others":"http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/zhou/lzhou.html","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"Atmospheric & Environmental Sciences","InstitutionalPage":"https://www.albany.edu/daes/faculty/liming-zhou","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"College of Arts and Sciences","Photopath":"lzhou@albany.edu.jpg"},{"Title":"Ms.","Email":"thuang3@albany.edu","LastName":"Huang","FirstName":"Tianning","PhoneNumber":"TEST","JobTitle":"TEST","Keyword1":"","Keyword2":"","Keyword3":"","Keyword4":"","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"","CV":"","ResearchGate":"","GoogleScholar":"","Others":"","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"TEST","InstitutionalPage":"","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"College of Arts and Sciences","Photopath":"placeholder.jpg"},{"Title":"Ms.","Email":"epaltz@albany.edu","LastName":"Paltz","FirstName":"Emily","PhoneNumber":"","JobTitle":"Research and Development Associate","Keyword1":"Emergency Management","Keyword2":"Social Science","Keyword3":"Tropical Cyclones","Keyword4":"Hurricanes","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"","CV":"","ResearchGate":"","GoogleScholar":"","Others":"","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"Center of Excellence in Weather and Climate Analytics","InstitutionalPage":"","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"University-wide Research Center","Photopath":"epaltz@albany.edu.jpg"},{"Title":"Ms.","Email":"epaltz@albany.edu","LastName":"Paltz","FirstName":"Emily","PhoneNumber":"","JobTitle":"Research and Development Associate ","Keyword1":"Emergency Management","Keyword2":"Social Science","Keyword3":"Tropical Cyclones","Keyword4":"Hurricanes","Keyword5":"","Keyword6":"","Keyword7":"","ResearchExpertise":"","CV":"","ResearchGate":"","GoogleScholar":"","Others":"","Project1":"","Project2":"","Project3":"","Project4":"","Project5":"","Course1":"","Course2":"","Course3":"","Course4":"","Course5":"","University":"","Department":"Center of Excellence in Weather and Climate Analytics","InstitutionalPage":"","UAlbanyCollegeSchoolDivision":"University-wide Research Center","Photopath":"epaltz@albany.edu.jpg"}]
